# CodeQL in a codespace

This repository contains premade workspace for trying out CodeQL, made by 
Peter StÃ¶ckli (@p-) and adapted to the exercises in the CodeQL zero to hero series. 

 **Please follow these instructions to the end** (including the [Select CodeQL Database](#select-codeql-database) and [Test your installation](#test-your-installation) sections).

You can choose between several options to do the exercises:
* [Recommended: GitHub Codespace](#github-codespace) (Using a Browser or VS Code - CodeQL is run remotely on a Linux based GitHub Codespace in the cloud)
* Local installation 
* CodeQL CLI
* CodeQL in neovim
* CodeQL in emacs 

## GitHub Codespace

Use a remote GitHub Codespace to work on the workshop exercises.

### Prerequisites

* GitHub account ([sign up](https://github.com/) for free)
* Browser or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) with the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension installed on your local machine.

Note: The first 120h hours per core of Codespace usage are free per month, we use a codespace with 4 cores for this workshop since 4 cores is the current maximum for free accounts. (If you have a Pro account, we recommend switching to an 8-core machine.)

### Step-by-Step

1. Login to your [GitHub](https://github.com/login) account
2. Go to the repo https://github.com/sylwia-budzynska/vscode-codeql-starter-codespace
3. Click on Code -> Codespaces
4. Click on the plus sign (+) to create a new codespace.

=> VS Code will start in your browser and a remote Codespace will be built (this may take some time).
If you are asked to open the workspace `vscode-codeql-starter.code-workspace` click on "Open Workspace".

5. Continue with [Selecting a CodeQL Database](#select-codeql-database)
6. Then [Test your installation](#test-your-installation)

### Use existing Codespace

If you've already prepared a Codespace this workshop you can simply start it by going to the [codespace repo](https://github.com/sylwia-budzynska/vscode-codeql-starter-codespace) and clicking on "Code -> Codespaces" and then click on the randomly generated name of this codespace (this will be faster than creating a new one):

## Select CodeQL Database

1. Make sure you have the workspace `vscode-codeql-starter.code-workspace` open in VS Code.
2. Go To the CodeQL View
3. Click on "Choose Database from Archive" and select the `vulnerable-jxpath-project-codeql-db-with-cache.zip` file in the root of the repository.

Now you can test your installation:

## Test your installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure that the previously chosen CodeQL database is selected in the CodeQL view. (Click on "Select" if it's not)

=> When the database is selected it should look like this (note the checkmark):

### Step-by-Step

1. In VS Code: go to the workspace folder: `codeql-custom-queries-java`
2. Create a new file `test.ql`
3. add the following content: `select "Hello World!"`
4. Save file and right click in file on "CodeQL: Run Query on Selected Database"

=>  The output should look like this:
